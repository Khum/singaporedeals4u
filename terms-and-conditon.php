                       <p>After the pre-payment authorisation via Paypal is received, SingaporeDeals4U.com will contact the Tour Operator to be ensure that the service is available for the exact period and for the requested number of participants.</p>

<p>It is the aim of SingaporeDeals4U.com to confirm the accommodation availability to the visitor within 12 hours. It is only after SingaporeDeals4U.com has confirmed the booking availability with the Tour Operator that payment is taken. A confirmation email will then be sent to the guest that will include all details and the contact details of the Tour Operator.</p>

<p>If the Tour is not available during the requested time period, then no payment will be taken. However, alternatives may be offered if available. If the visitor wishes to choose one of the alternatives suggested, then the visitor would need to start the booking process again on SingaporeDeals4u.com website to book the Tour.</p>


<p>SingaporeDeals4U.com aims to confirm the availability of the Tour to the visitor within 12 hours.  Once we have informed the visitor that the Tour is available, we will hold the particular Tour for another 12 hours, in which time the visitor needs to initiate the money transfer if requested by us. The visitor has 48 hours in which to make the payment and send us proof thereof. It is only then that the Tour booking process is completed and your Tour fully reserved.</p>

<p>If we do not receive payment within 48 hours, the Tour inventory will be released again and the visitor’s request will be cancelled. If the visitor is still interested in the Tour, unfortunately the booking process will need to be started again from the beginning.</p>
